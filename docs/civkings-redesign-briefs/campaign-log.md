## Calibration transcripts

### C1 (2026-08-24, BASE 2092b0c, gate f2dd97feb5db182f)

BASE run (expect clean FAIL — features absent):

```
s7.surface.ladder: FAIL game.ladder missing
s7.surface.beats: FAIL game.beats missing
s7.surface.acts: FAIL game.acts missing
s7.surface.registry: FAIL gilded.ui.registry missing
s11.surface.ladder: FAIL game.ladder missing
s11.surface.beats: FAIL game.beats missing
s11.surface.acts: FAIL game.acts missing
s11.surface.registry: FAIL gilded.ui.registry missing
GATE: MISS (8 fails)   exit 1, no traceback
```

Cheat-stub run (perturb_c1.py — constant ranks, empty-cause provenance,
signature-only beats, hollow registry; discriminators must FAIL):

```
s7/s11.G1.1c: FAIL rank order never changed across 20 turns
s7/s11.G1.3a.season|inquiry|deflection: FAIL kinds seen: ['signature']
s7/s11.G1.3c: FAIL inquire('stub')
s7/s11.G1.4a.verbs: FAIL 1 verbs
GATE: MISS (12 fails)  — stub cannot pass; gate discriminates.
```

Known accepted residual: a delta list containing only trivial self-consistent
Attributeds could satisfy G1.2; countered by G1.3c (causes>=1), the brief's
"deltas() IS the render source" contract (asserted structurally in C4), and
mutation sweep at verdict.

### C2 (2026-08-25, FINAL — re-calibrated on post-C1 BASE a418d49; the
### provisional pre-C1 run gave identical discriminators. gate 1f6b4bc6ca740b5b)

BASE run on a418d49 (full gate incl. C1 chain): identical C2 fails to the
transcript below, plus 150 PASS — the entire C1 regression chain runs green
inside the C2 gate. Stub run on a418d49: identical to the transcript below
(perturb updated to piggyback the real C1 beats facade, which chassis's
end_turn_close call now requires).

Original provisional BASE run (pre-C1 tree, `CYNCO_GATE_SKIP_C1=1`; expect clean
FAIL — features absent):

```
s7/s11/s13.surface.set_ambition: FAIL game.set_ambition missing
s7/s11/s13.surface.ambitions: FAIL game.ambitions missing
s7/s11/s13.surface.ui.house: FAIL gilded.ui.house missing
G2.2b: FAIL AttributeError("'Character' object has no attribute 'want'")
G2.2c: FAIL stances across seeds: []
G2.3.achievable: FAIL no ambition ever fulfilled: []
G2.3.failable: FAIL no ambition ever failed: []
GATE: MISS (13 fails)  exit 1, no traceback
```

Cheat-stub run (perturb_c2.py — every want "backs" with first disposition key,
banner clock frozen at "turn 1 of 10", ambitions always fulfilled; skips the C1
regression chain via `CYNCO_GATE_SKIP_C1`; discriminators must FAIL):

```
s7.G2.4b.t4: FAIL banner={'family': 'Consolidation', 'clock': 'turn 1 of 10'}
s11.G2.4b.t4: FAIL banner={'family': 'Glory', 'clock': 'turn 1 of 10'}
s13.G2.4b.t4: FAIL banner={'family': 'Buyout', 'clock': 'turn 1 of 10'}
G2.2c: FAIL stances across seeds: ['backs']
G2.3.failable: FAIL no ambition ever failed: [True, True, True]
GATE: MISS (5 fails), 180 checks PASS — stub cannot pass; gate discriminates.
```

Stub notes: real `intel.report` runs unmodified against the stubbed agenda
(tier-3 path reads `goal.why`); `gilded.provenance.Cause(label, amount, source)`.
Known accepted residuals: G2.2a cannot tell a genuinely disposition-derived want
from a want that merely name-drops a disposition key — countered by G2.2c
(stance diversity across seeds must emerge from the derivation) and mutation
sweep at verdict. G2.3.achievable/failable need both outcomes across the
3-seed grid; a degenerate coin-flip implementation could satisfy them but would
break G2.2b determinism and the honest-levers rule.
